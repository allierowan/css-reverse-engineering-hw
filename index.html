        <p class="poem-line"><span>S</span>hall I compare thee to a summer’s day?</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>T</span>hou art more lovely and more temperate:</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>R</span>ough winds do shake the darling buds of May,</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>A</span>nd summer’s lease hath all too short a date;</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>S</span>ometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>A</span>nd often is his gold complexion dimm'd;</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>A</span>nd every fair from fair sometime declines,</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>B</span>y chance or nature’s changing course untrimm'd;</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>B</span>ut thy eternal summer shall not fade,</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>N</span>or lose possession of that fair thou ow’st;</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>N</span>or shall death brag thou wander’st in his shade,</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>W</span>hen in eternal lines to time thou grow’st:</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>S</span>o long as men can breathe or eyes can see,</p>
        <p class="poem-line"><span>S</span>o long lives this, and this gives life to thee.</p>
